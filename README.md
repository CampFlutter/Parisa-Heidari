## Parisa's Homeworks âœ¨

Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub repository. My name is Parisa, and these files contain the homework assignments and projects I've completed for my course.

Feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or notice any mistakes. I'm always happy to clarify things or make corrections. You can reach me at parisa.heiidari@gmail.com .

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find my work interesting :)ðŸ’™.
